  Aim of this project is to design an efficient, userfriendly, and effective portal to manage various teaching activities for the students as well as professors.It is a web based 
  portal (such as egov portal) through which the professor can coordinate with students as well as students can post their queries or can easily get the study materials posted by 
  professors or submit the assignments provided by the professor. The students can also check their exam results on the linked moodle platform all the students details are 
  provided on the page.
  It does not only provide the communication channel between students and professor but the data privacy is also taken care of.Each and every students have their login details such as username and password and with using this credentials they can login to their portal. Students can not see any onther students data and also no student can modify any data 
  egarding to results, attendence or fees status etc.Authorised professor can upload/modify data for any student.
  
	
  Professor can post any study materials/assignments on the portal and students can download this as file. For these assignments also students have no permission to modify the 
  statements of assignment. The portal also provides convienient platform for the professor to access or save the works the students have done.
  
	
  Students can also work on any given task in a group.There are tools provided to do this kind of group activities.The students can also link their GitHub accounts to the portal 
  and help each other out on the group projects.
  
  linking github will impact a lot as then , students can use github as their college assignments submitting platform to build up thier CV which will help them in the future, and 
  the proffessors can access the assignments with ease from the portal
  
The goal is to make the online teaching/studying a little bit more interactive and easy for students as well as for the Professors by making the interface of the programme/portal 
as userfriendly as possible with keeping data and privacy intact at the same tim
